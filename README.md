## evaluation
- To which degree does the application really fulfil the customer needs?

The application satisfies the requirements in a sufficient manner. The quiz's subjects can be chosen, questions can be answered, users can get feedback on their choices, move through the test, see their score, and play again. In addition, the app satisfies all stated user criteria with its responsive design, keyboard navigation, hover and focus states, and theme toggling functionality.

- How did the candidate utilize git-flow processes (feature branches etc. pull requests)?

I developed using an organized git-flow procedure, working alone the entire time, and as a result, I only made one branch.

- How well did the design appeal to the user, colour combination, consistency, and
usability?

I gave the design elements a lot of thought, concentrating on usability, consistency, and color scheme. In order to create a user experience that is both engaging and intuitive. To guarantee a consistent look and feel across various devices, responsive design concepts and consistent styling across components were implemented.

- How well did the candidate present his/her results?

My goal was to present the results with precision and thoroughness. The application clearly and understandably displays quiz results and feedback to users, successfully communicating the results. The quiz's user interface is easy to use and leads users through the process with ease. In addition, I gave customers comprehensive documentation and guidance on how to use the app and navigate it.
